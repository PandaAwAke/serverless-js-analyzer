To do:

- Some missing dates in here: https://changelogs.md/github/patrickdavey/wimwiki_markdown/
- labco/create-react-app weird dates
- Detect forks (aka dedupe the 14k create-react-app)
- Support [Unreleased] as in gitbrent/pptxgenjs
- weird date in alhadis/atom-mocha
- Adjust autocomplete fragment scoring so that fragments
  at the start of the complete phrase have higher scores
  than fragments at the end of the phrase
- If the version changes are just a diff link then put that
  link the generated HTML: ianchi/ESpression, tomchentw/react-prism,
  also do something about filtering out diff
  links: digidem/openrosa-request-middleware and brodybits/prettierx
- missed date here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alhadis/Atom-Mocha/master/CHANGELOG.md
- An inline code block broken here: soeasy/meta-validate
- bad parse: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hengkx/web-deploy/master/CHANGELOG.md
- Support getting the releases from Github as well? https://github.com/alex3165/react-mapbox-gl

Maybe do:

- Figure out something to deal with people do dates like DD.MM.YYYY as
in: tonyganch/gonzales-pe, and kevinqqnj/cordova-template-vuetify-webpack

Done:

- ember-lifeline/ember-lifeline random version number interpreted as date
- hucy/component-build-script has no dates
- jpeer264/toastr doesn't parse correctly
- kevinqqnj/cordova-template-vuetify-webpack has dates as version numbers
- jhnns/rewire
- Filter out 0.0.0-semantically-released autogenerated crap as in: nodkz/graphql-compose-mongoose
- Investigate random 1998 date in tsqllint/tsqllint
- Filter out these random version numbers: flickr/flickr-sdk
- Normalize all changelogs by sorting the version descending: spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia
- random invalid date: beautify-web/js-beautify
- Remove all content inside HTML comments: catamphetamine/react-responsive-ui, apache/incubator-openwhisk-composer
